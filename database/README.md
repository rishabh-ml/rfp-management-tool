## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Error: "relation does not exist"**
- Make sure to run scripts in the correct order
- Check that all previous scripts completed successfully

**Error: "permission denied"** 
- Ensure your Supabase user has sufficient privileges
- Try running as database owner

**Error: "function does not exist"**
- Make sure `02_enhanced_functions.sql` ran successfully  
- Check the Supabase logs for function creation errors

### Verification Queries

Check if the reset was successful:

```sql
-- Check tables were created
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public';

-- Check enhanced project fields
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'projects' 
ORDER BY ordinal_position;

-- Check sample data (if loaded)
SELECT COUNT(*) as project_count FROM public.projects;
SELECT COUNT(*) as user_count FROM public.users;
```

## Backup Recommendation

Before running the reset scripts, consider backing up any important data:

```sql
-- Export existing projects (example)
COPY (SELECT * FROM projects) TO '/path/to/backup/projects.csv' CSV HEADER;
```

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the Supabase logs in your dashboard
2. Verify your environment variables are correct
3. Ensure your Clerk integration is properly configured
4. Review the RLS policies if you have access issues
