# Dynamic and Collapsible Gantt View Implementation

## Changes Made

### ✅ **Replaced Dummy Data with Dynamic Data**
The Gantt view now uses real project data from the `projects` prop instead of hardcoded dummy data.

**Key improvements:**
- Filters projects based on search query, stage filter, and priority filter
- Uses actual project data including titles, stages, priorities, progress percentages
- Calculates start and end dates from project creation and due dates
- Shows real owner information and subtask counts
- Displays actual project progress and completion status

### ✅ **Added Collapsible Functionality**
Both the timeline and statistics sections are now collapsible with smooth animations.

**Features added:**
- **Timeline Section**: Collapsible with chevron indicators
- **Statistics Section**: Collapsible with dynamic calculations
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear expand/collapse indicators
- **Smooth Animations**: CSS transitions for better UX

### ✅ **Enhanced Project Information Display**
**Timeline Section:**
- Project count badge in header
- Owner names displayed for each project
- Subtask progress indicators (completed/total)
- Enhanced stage-based color coding (including 'won', 'lost' stages)
- Better progress bar visualization
- Empty state when no projects match criteria

**Statistics Section:**
- **Timeline Overview**: Total, in-progress, completed, and unassigned projects
- **Progress Analysis**: Average progress, on-track vs at-risk projects, total subtasks
- **Priority Distribution**: Count by priority level (urgent, high, medium, low)
- All statistics calculated dynamically from actual project data

### ✅ **Improved User Experience**
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on different screen sizes
- **Interactive Elements**: Clickable project links and collapsible sections
- **Better Visual Hierarchy**: Clear section organization and consistent styling
- **Loading States**: Proper handling of empty states
- **Real-time Data**: Uses current project data with proper filtering

## New Components Created

### `Collapsible` UI Component
- Custom implementation compatible with the existing design system
- Smooth expand/collapse animations
- Accessible interaction patterns

## Files Modified

### `/src/components/projects/project-gantt-view.tsx`
- Complete rewrite to use dynamic data
- Added collapsible functionality
- Enhanced visual design and information display
- Improved statistics calculations

### `/src/components/ui/collapsible.tsx` (New)
- Custom collapsible component implementation
- Smooth animations and proper state management

## Result

The Gantt view now provides:
1. **Real project data** instead of dummy data
2. **Collapsible sections** for better space management
3. **Enhanced visual information** including owner details and subtask progress
4. **Dynamic statistics** calculated from actual project data
5. **Better filtering integration** with search and filter controls

The implementation maintains all existing functionality while adding the requested dynamic data and collapsible features.
